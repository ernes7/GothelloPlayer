What did you try to do?
- Minimax score search in Python. I added functions max and min to Bart's code in gthrandom.python
Using these functions, I was able to predict moves and return the best move possible based on a score.
How well did it work?
- I faced a lot of illegal moves at the beginning of the implmentation
but it got better after adjustments. I realized that I didnt twisted the logic
going from the max function to the min function and that was the main cause.
How did you evaluate your work?
I evaluated my work through the playing of games and checking
if the minimax won or lost. 

I counted situations like this, a win in my favor vs the client:

(...)
me: a5
O*O*.
OOO**
O.OO*
***O*
*.O.*
opp: d5
O*O*.
OOO**
O.OO*
***O*
*.OO*
me: b3
O*O*.
OOO**
O*OO*
***O*
*.OO*
opp: pass
me: pass to end game

What did you learn?
I learn about Minimax and also I read articles on Alpha Beta Pruning
which is a improved version. Altough I didnt implement Alpha Beta Pruning,
It probably would of work better that way
What would you like to try in the future?
I would like to try minimax AB Pruning in other board games. 
How do I reproduce your work (compile, run test)?
