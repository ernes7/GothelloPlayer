What did you try to do?
- Minimax score search in Python
How well did it work?
- I faced a lot of illegal moves at the beginning of the implmentation
but it got better after adjustments. I realized that I didnt twisted the logic
going from the max function to the min function and that was the main cause.
How did you evaluate your work?
I evaluated my work through the playing of games and checking
if the minimax won or lost. 
What did you learn?
I learn about Minimax and also I read articles on Alpha Beta Pruning
which is a improved version. Altough I didnt implement Alpha Beta Pruning,
It probably would of work better that way
What would you like to try in the future?
I would like to try minimax AB Pruning in other board games. 
How do I reproduce your work (compile, run test)?
