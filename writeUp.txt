What did you try to do?
- Minimax score search in Python. I added functions max and min to Bart's code in gthrandom.python
Using these functions, I was able to predict moves and return the best move possible based on a score.
The function max() always predicted a move ahead and based on that tree branch, it returns a score to be used later.
The function then evaluates the possible scores and return the max with arguments letter and digit to make a move there.
The function min() tries to minimize the score of the opponent, and works the same way but in reverse. 
In a separate folder I tried to add a scoring function but I was not able due to game restrictions and rules
that I did not have in mind.
For example, the scoring function was difficult to implement due to the program not applying
the "capture" rule of the gothello game. In other words, I was not able to flip the tiles.

How well did it work?
- I faced a lot of illegal moves at the beginning of the implmentation
but it got better after adjustments. I realized that I didnt twisted the logic
going from the max function to the min function and that was the main cause. 
Also, as I explained before, the scoring function was not implemented fully due to
my code not able to figure out how to simulate the "flip the tiles" scenario. I ended up
deleting the scoring function.

How did you evaluate your work?
I evaluated my work through the playing of games and checking
if the minimax won or lost. My initial idea of evalutation was to
implement a scoring function.

I counted situations like this, a win in my favor vs the client:

(...)
me: a5
O*O*.
OOO**
O.OO*
***O*
*.O.*
opp: d5
O*O*.
OOO**
O.OO*
***O*
*.OO*
me: b3
O*O*.
OOO**
O*OO*
***O*
*.OO*
opp: pass
me: pass to end game.

In that case, my player wins 12-11 (tiles counting) vs the python client.

What did you learn?
I learn about Minimax and also I read articles on Alpha Beta Pruning
which is a improved version. Altough I fully didnt implement Alpha Beta Pruning,
It probably would of work better that way. I also learned about Gothello, it was really
interesting to interact and play a game made by Bart Massey, this is something unique
that gives the students some motivation when doing the assignment. 

What would you like to try in the future?
I would like to try minimax AB Pruning in other board games.
Also, it will interesting to apply a learner given data of played games.
Definetely an interesting approach.  

How do I reproduce your work (compile, run test)?
it uses barton.cs.pdx.edu and run this way : python3 gthErnesto.py black
